Ensuring my code, program, or software is functional and secure is essential to ensure that it performs as intended and doesn't expose users to security risks. In order to achieve this, I need to use a reliable development methodology. A methodology involves a structured approach to developing software, which includes planning, designing, testing, and deployment. Conducting regular code reviews can help catch any bugs or vulnerabilities in code before they become a problem. Using automated testing tools can help test code more efficiently and thoroughly. Keeping software up to date, using secure coding practices, and conducting security testing can help identify security vulnerabilities in the software that could be exploited by hackers. Interpreting user needs will require conducting user research which will then be used to develop user personas to better understand users and their needs. This will help to identify the most important user needs and focusing on those in the program development. The addition of developing user stories to better understand how users will interact with the program and what they need to do, along with incorporating user feedback to ensure it meets their needs. I approach designing software by defining the problem that I am trying to solve , nailing down user personas and stories, then designing the user interface, creating the software architecture, developing and testing prototypes, and then refining and iterating on the design.
